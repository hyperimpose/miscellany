* hi_links

An Erlang/OTP application for extracting links from text.
Supports RFC 3986 URIs and RFC 3987 IRIs.

** Build

This library is built using rebar3. You can include it in your projects as a dependency in rebar.config:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  {deps, [%% ... Other dependencies
         {hi_links, {git_subdir, "https://github.com/hyperimpose/miscellany.git", {branch, "master"}, "hi_links"}}]}.
#+END_SRC

You can also quickly compile the library and start an Erlang shell for testing with: ~rebar3 shell~

** API Usage
There are two modules available:
- hi_uri :: Use this to extract URIs
- hi_iri :: Use this to extract IRIs

Both of those modules export a single function: ~find/1~.

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
%% Given the following string:
S = "Visit https://hyperimpose.org to find more programs".

%% We can extract the link with:
{ok, Links} = hi_iri:find(S),

%% This function will return a list with the URL in it.
#+END_SRC
