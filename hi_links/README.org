* hi_links

An Erlang/OTP application for extracting links from text.
Supports RFC 3986 URIs and RFC 3987 IRIs.

** Build
Polycache can be built using GNU Make (other make implementations may work).

To built the application run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
#+END_SRC

This will create an ~/ebin~ directory that contains the compiled code.

To remove all build artifacts run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make clean
#+END_SRC

** API Usage
There are two modules available:
- hi_uri :: Use this to extract URIs
- hi_iri :: Use this to extract IRIs

Both of those modules export a single function: ~find/1~.

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
%% Given the following string:
S = "Visit hyperimpose.org to find more programs".

%% We can extract the link with:
{ok, Links} = hi_iri:find(S),

%% This function will return a list with the URL in it.
#+END_SRC
