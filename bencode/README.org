* bencode

An erlang implementation of Bittorrent's bencode format. See: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html
  
** Notes and Warnings

- There is no depth limit.
- It does not provide useful error messages for invalid input.

** API Usage

There are two functions exported by ~bencode~: decode/1 and encode/1.

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  %% Encode an erlang term:
  %%
  %% This function will return the following bencoded binary:
  %% <<"d4:testi123ee">>
  bencode:encode(#{<<"test" => 123>>}).

  %% Decode an erlang term:
  %%
  %% This function will return an erlang dictionary:
  %% #{<<"test" => 123>>}
  bencode:decode(<<"d4:testi123ee">>).

  %% See the next section for the supported terms and their equivalents.
#+END_SRC

** Term Mapping

The bencoded values map to Erlang terms as follows:
- Dictionaries <-> Maps #{}  (If there are duplicate keys the last one is kept)
- Lists        <-> Lists []  (Including strings/iolists etc.)
- Integers     <-> Integers
- Strings      <-> Binaries

Atoms or other terms are not supported.
